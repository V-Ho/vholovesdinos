          <p> Few people know much about <strong>Stegosaurus </strong> beyond the fact that a) it had triangular plates on its back, b) it was dumber than the average dinosaur, and c) its plastic figurine looks really cool on an office desk. Here are a few more cool facts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stegosaurus had a brain the size of a walnut</li>
            <li>Its' spiked tail is called a <strong>thagomizer</strong>, a term coined by <em>Far Side</em> creator Gary Larson, and used by paleontologists ever since.</ol>
            <li>The dinosaur supplemented its diet with small rocks, possibly to help digest the hundreds of pounds of ferns digested each day</li>
        </ul>
